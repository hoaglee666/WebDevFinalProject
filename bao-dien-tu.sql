Startups and established corporations are all vying for the attention of these skilled individuals. Dubbed the ‘tech talent crunch,’ this presents an exciting yet challenging opportunity for businesses and individuals operating in the region.\r\n\r\nMust-know facts about the ‘tech talent crunch’\r\nIt goes both ways. SEA countries have been generating a lot of the highest-quality tech talents. At the same time, this surge in tech talents comes with the increasing demand for digital and remote professions—which rose further due to the pandemic.\r\n\r\nCheck out the statistics:\r\n\r\nTech roles earn more than 38% on average compared to non-tech roles\r\nEngineering holds the top spot in terms of salary—VPs of Engineering make more than $235,000 annually. Product and data roles are the next in-demand.\r\n“Software developer” tops the list of most in-demand jobs this 2023, according to Bloomberg\r\nThe aggregate valuation of Southeast Asia’s tech startups was $340 billion in 2020, and it will triple by 2025. \r\nIt is predicted that specific sectors of the tech job market will continue to grow due to Southeast Asia’s growing economics and increasing demand for tech and digital skills—specifically cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity.\r\nWhat do these numbers tell us? The tech talent crunch is not going anywhere anytime soon. Companies that want to stay on top must know how to take advantage of this.\r\n\r\nHow can your company make the most of the tech talent surge in SEA?\r\nAs one of many businesses looking to stand out and rise above the rest, it’s a given that you’re also seeking to hire the best of the best tech talents.\r\n\r\nYes, the quantity of potential hires as of late is plentiful. However, you’ll need a lot more than just available positions to attract these high-quality tech talents from Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThere’s even a bigger question: Is your company ready to accommodate this rise of tech talent? What do you need to divert this huge mass of high-demand talent your way?\r\n\r\nTo help you get all your bases covered, here’s a checklist you can use for your reference:\r\n\r\nConduct thorough market research and talent mapping\r\nDon’t go shooting in the dark. Understand what specific tech talents you’re looking for and where to find them. Create a solid talent mapping strategy so you know where to focus your recruitment efforts at.\r\n\r\nMapping out where the talents you’re looking for are from is crucial. You’ll get a better idea of the requirements you’ll need to fulfill to best attract those specific talents to your company.\r\n\r\nEstablish and flesh out your remote work policies\r\nDevelop clear and comprehensive remote work policies. They should outline your company’s expectations, communication protocols, and performance evaluation criteria. Doing so can help align both your company and your remote tech talents to work seamlessly together.\r\n\r\nObserve cultural sensitivity and awareness\r\nFamiliarise your company staff with the cultural norms and working practices in Southeast Asia. Observing adequate cultural sensitivity can help you build strong relationships. In turn, you’ll get a better understanding of what motivates your target tech talents in SEA.\r\n\r\nPromote practices that help break down language barriers\r\nConsider providing adequate language support resources. This can help create clear and effective communication between your talents and in-house team. While English is widely spoken in Southeast Asia, it’s important to understand the different nuances of foreign languages. After all, language is not just about words.\r\n\r\nLanguage barriers can lead to unintended misunderstandings. Such miscommunication could hinder collaboration between your company and your remote talents.\r\n\r\nConsider implementing flexible working hours\r\nAccepting remote talents means you should be ready to accept the concept of flexible working hours. Show your potential remote tech talents that you’re committed to fostering work-life balance among a team that works different timezones.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true for tech talents in Indonesia. In one survey, as much as 85% of respondents demanded work flexibility.\r\n\r\nAdapt more localised recruitment and hiring practices\r\nIf you are aiming to hire remote tech talents from Southeast Asia, then have your recruitment and hiring processes cater to Southeast Asian candidates specifically.\r\n\r\nOne thing you can do to help with this is to partner with local recruiting agencies. Another would be attending job fairs in your target region. Conducting virtual interviews is also a great way to immediately reach out to your tech talent candidates.\r\n\r\nEncourage personal and professional development for your tech talents\r\nSoutheast Asian tech talents value skill and career growth opportunities. Highlight your company’s commitment to supporting your talents’ drive for personal growth. This is a big factor that can help you not only attract top talent—but also retain them.\r\n\r\nArm your tech talents with the necessary resources\r\nOne great gesture is to provide your remote tech talents with the technology they need to get started and to succeed. Even something as simple as providing internet allowance can go a long way.\r\n\r\nYou can also invest in reliable communication platforms. Give your remote talents a centralised and secure channel of communicating with you.', 7, 'Asia', 'nobody', NULL, 0);

Indonesia held steady while Singapore’s growth in the second quarter was a whisker 0.1 percent less than the previous quarter. Strong performance across services and manufacturing sectors, particularly in electronics, helped prop up the region’s economy. The Philippines and Vietnam continued as the region’s top two performing economies, growing at 6.3 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, with Malaysia coming in at third, having expanded by 5.9 percent.\r\n\r\nGrowth accelerated\r\n\r\nTrade holds up\r\n\r\nTrade momentum\r\nHaving turned a corner in the previous quarter, trade activities held up strongly in the second quarter 2024. This was driven by a strong global demand for chemicals and commodities, while the global tech upcycle boosted demand for electronics and consumer devices, which in turn supported the region’s exports momentum. Exports in all countries saw accelerated growth this quarter, except for the Philippines and Vietnam where growth moderated. Indonesia’s exports growth jumped from 1.37 percent in the first quarter 2024 to 8.28 percent in the second, while Malaysia’s exports growth more than doubled from 2.0 percent last quarter to 5.8 percent in the second quarter. Thailand saw a turnaround from a 1.1 percent contraction in exports last quarter to achieve a strong 4.5 percent growth this quarter, while Vietnam attained a double-digit growth of 12.5 percent this quarter, driven by strong exports’ performance in telephone, computers, electronics, and textile sectors.  \r\n\r\nIndustrial activity\r\nWhile Indonesia and the Philippines saw a moderation in industrial output growth in the second quarter, there were positive performances that came from the rest of the region. Malaysia’s output growth more than doubled in the second quarter on the back of strong performance from both domestic and exports producing sectors, while Thailand marked the first quarter of output expansion, having contracted for the past six quarters. Vietnam’s output continued to expand at a faster pace, while Singapore saw smaller contraction of 1 percent this quarter. The region has benefited from stronger external demand from sectors such as chemicals and electronics. The PMI of all countries in the region grew or remained above the expansionary 50.0 mark, except for Indonesia which saw a first contraction in PMI for the past 34 months. \r\n\r\nPromising output performance\r\n\r\nLabor\r\nLabor markets across the region continued to remain strong, with unemployment in most markets improving or holding steady. Indonesia saw its lowest unemployment rate since 1997; similarly, the Philippines, which recorded its lowest unemployment in two decades, and Malaysia’s unemployment situation normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Improvement in business activities and continued investments into the region drove higher demand for labor and helped keep the labor market tight. \r\n\r\nLabor markets remain strong\r\n\r\nPrices\r\nInflation broadly eased, with the Philippines and Vietnam being the only regional outliers that saw higher inflation in the second quarter. The Philippines experienced higher food inflation, which led to July’s rate breaching the Philippines central bank’s target range for the first time in 2024. Vietnam first breached the 4 percent mark in April 2024 and its monthly inflation has since remained above this figure. \r\n\r\nInflation broadly eased\r\n\r\nFinancial markets\r\nCurrency\r\nThe majority of Southeast Asia currencies continued to retreat against the US dollar in the second quarter 2024. The Indonesia rupiah and Vietnam dong saw the greatest decline, while the Philippines peso fell to its weakest level since 2022. The Malaysia ringgit and Singapore dollar bucked the trend and held steady during the quarter. With signs pointing to a likelihood of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in the third quarter, all Southeast Asian currencies have seen some strengthening since July.

Even the Arctic Ocean suffered a marine heatwave.\r\n \r\nAsia is warming faster than the global average. The warming trend has nearly doubled since the 1961–1990 period.\r\n \r\n“The report\'s conclusions are sobering. Many countries in the region experienced their hottest year on record in 2023, along with a barrage of extreme conditions, from droughts and heatwaves to floods and storms. Climate change exacerbated the frequency and severity of such events, profoundly impacting societies, economies, and, most importantly, human lives and the environment that we live in,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.\r\n \r\nIn 2023, a total of 79 disasters associated with hydro-meteorological hazard events were reported in Asia according to the Emergency Events Database. Of these, over 80% were related to flood and storm events, with more than 2 000 fatalities and nine million people directly affected. Despite the growing health risks posed by extreme heat, heat-related mortality is frequently not reported.\r\n\r\n“Yet again, in 2023, vulnerable countries were disproportionately impacted. For example, tropical cyclone Mocha, the strongest cyclone in the Bay of Bengal in the last decade, hit Bangladesh and Myanmar. Early warning and better preparedness saved thousands of lives,” said Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which partnered in producing the report.\r\n \r\n“In this context, the State of the Climate in Asia 2023 report is an effort to bridge gaps between climate science and disaster risk through evidence-based policy proposals. ESCAP and WMO, working in partnership, will continue to invest in raising climate ambition and accelerating the implementation of sound policy, including bringing an early warning to all in the region so that no one is left behind as our climate change crisis continues to evolve,” she said.\r\n \r\nApproximately 80% of WMO Members in the region provide climate services to support disaster risk reduction activities. However, less than 50% of Members provide climate projections and tailored products that are needed to inform risk management and adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and its impacts, according to the report.\r\n \r\nThe report, one of a series of WMO regional State of the Climate reports, was released during the 80th session of the Commission in Bangkok, Thailand. It is based on input from National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, United Nations partners and a network of climate experts. It reflects WMO’s commitment to prioritize regional initiatives and inform decision-making.\r\n\r\nTemperatures\r\nThe annual mean near-surface temperature over Asia in 2023 was the second highest on record, 0.91 °C [0.84 °C–0.96 °C] above the 1991–2020 average and 1.87 °C [1.81 °C–1.92 °C] above the 1961–1990 average.
